# Local-First Timeline Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've implemented a local-first approach for the timeline that drastically reduces bandwidth usage by:
1. Loading all timeline data once and caching it locally
2. Only fetching from server when user adds/modifies content
3. No automatic refreshing or polling

## Changes Made

### 1. New Hook: `useLocalFirstTimeline`
- Loads ALL timeline items at once (no pagination needed)
- Caches data in AsyncStorage for 24 hours
- Only fetches from server when:
  - Cache is empty
  - Cache is older than 24 hours
  - User explicitly requests refresh
  - `forceSync()` is called after user makes changes

### 2. New Convex Query: `getAllTimelineItems`
- Returns all timeline items for a baby in one query
- Combines data from all tables (photos, journal, milestones, etc.)
- Sorted by date descending

### 3. Event System for Updates
- Created `eventEmitter.ts` for cross-component communication
- When user adds/modifies content, emits `TIMELINE_REFRESH_NEEDED` event
- Timeline listens for this event and calls `forceSync()`

### 4. Updated Components
- **TimelineScreen**: Uses `useLocalFirstTimeline` instead of infinite scroll
- **AddMemoryModal**: Emits refresh event when memory is added
- **MilestoneLogModal**: Emits refresh event when milestone is updated
- **AppNavigator**: Handles memory added callback

## Benefits

1. **Bandwidth Reduction**
   - No constant polling or automatic refreshes
   - No pagination queries as you scroll
   - Images loaded from local storage first

2. **Better Performance**
   - Instant loading from cache
   - No loading spinners when scrolling
   - Works offline with cached data

3. **User Control**
   - Pull-to-refresh still works
   - Updates only when user makes changes
   - Predictable data fetching

## How It Works

1. **First Load**:
   - Fetches all timeline items once
   - Caches in AsyncStorage
   - Shows instantly on next app launch

2. **User Adds Content**:
   - Content saved locally first
   - Event emitted to refresh timeline
   - Timeline fetches latest data and updates cache

3. **Offline Mode**:
   - Shows cached data
   - User can still add content (saved locally)
   - Syncs when back online

## Testing

1. Load timeline - should fetch once and cache
2. Close and reopen app - should load instantly from cache
3. Add photo/milestone - should trigger single refresh
4. Check Convex logs - minimal function calls
5. Monitor bandwidth - should be drastically reduced

## Future Improvements

1. Implement delta sync - only fetch changes since last sync
2. Add background sync when app is in background
3. Implement conflict resolution for multi-device usage
4. Add cache versioning for data structure changes
