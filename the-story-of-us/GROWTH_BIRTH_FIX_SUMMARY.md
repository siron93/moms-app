# Fixed Growth Cards and Birth Announcement

## Issues Found

1. **Growth Cards were empty** because:
   - Timeline query wasn't including actual growth measurements (weight, height, etc.)
   - Only included the growthLogId but not the data
   - TimelineScreen was creating a growthData object with undefined values

2. **Birth Announcement** issues:
   - Hardcoded weight (7 lbs 2 oz) and length (20 inches)
   - Using stock photo instead of actual baby photo

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Timeline Queries
- Added growth measurements to `TimelineItem` type
- Modified both `getAllTimelineItems` and `getTimelinePaginated` to include:
  - weight, weightUnit
  - height, heightUnit  
  - headCircumference, headCircumferenceUnit

### 2. Updated TimelineScreen
- Modified to use actual growth data from memory object
- Now passes complete growth data to GrowthCard component

### 3. Fixed BirthAnnouncementCard
- Uses actual baby.birthWeight and baby.birthLength
- Shows units (lbs/kg, in/cm) from baby data
- Uses baby's photo if available (from memory.mediaUrl)
- Falls back to stock photo only if no photo exists

## To Test

1. **Clear cache and refresh timeline**:
   - Pull to refresh on timeline
   - This will fetch data with new structure

2. **Check Growth Cards**:
   - Should now show actual weight/height values
   - Example: "Weight: 15.5 lbs | Height: 25 in"

3. **Check Birth Announcement**:
   - Should show actual birth weight/length if set
   - Should use baby's photo if one was added

## Note
The app needs to refresh its cached timeline data to get the new structure with growth measurements. After pulling to refresh, all growth cards should display properly.
