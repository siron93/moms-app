# Convex Upload Disabled Summary

This document summarizes all changes made to disable Convex uploads and use local storage only.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/hooks/useBackgroundUpload.ts`
- Disabled `processUploads` function - returns early with console log
- Background processing interval still runs but does nothing

### 2. `/src/services/uploadHelpers.ts`
- `queueMediaUpload` - disabled, logs message and returns
- `queueMultipleMediaUploads` - disabled, logs message and returns

### 3. `/src/screens/AddPhotoScreen.tsx`
- Modified to use local permanent paths as `mediaUrls` instead of placeholders
- Still saves media permanently but doesn't upload to Convex
- Queuing for upload is disabled via uploadHelpers

### 4. `/src/components/MilestoneLogModal.tsx`
- Disabled `uploadMediaToConvex` call
- Uses local path as `photoUrl` when saving new photos
- Original upload code is commented out

### 5. `/src/services/startupService.ts`
- Already disabled - no uploads on startup
- Only logs pending upload count

## Components Using Local Storage

### OptimizedImage Component
- Prioritizes local paths over cloud URLs
- Only fetches from Convex as last resort
- Logs warning when loading from Convex

### Media Display
- All timeline cards use OptimizedImage component
- Local paths are checked first before cloud URLs

## Expected Behavior

1. **New Photos/Videos**
   - Saved permanently to app's document directory
   - Local path used as both `mediaUrl` and `localMediaPath`
   - No upload to Convex cloud storage

2. **Milestone Photos**
   - Saved locally only
   - Local path used as `photoUrl`

3. **Background Upload Service**
   - Runs but does nothing (returns early)
   - No bandwidth usage from uploads

4. **Image Loading**
   - Always tries local path first
   - Falls back to cloud URL only if local doesn't exist
   - Should minimize bandwidth for existing images

## Testing

To verify uploads are disabled:
1. Add new photos/videos - should save instantly without upload delay
2. Check Convex logs - no new upload-related function calls
3. Monitor bandwidth usage - should be minimal
4. All images should still display correctly using local paths

## Reverting Changes

To re-enable uploads, uncomment the disabled code in:
- `useBackgroundUpload.ts` - processUploads function
- `uploadHelpers.ts` - both queue functions  
- `MilestoneLogModal.tsx` - uploadMediaToConvex call
- `AddPhotoScreen.tsx` - change back to placeholder URLs if needed
