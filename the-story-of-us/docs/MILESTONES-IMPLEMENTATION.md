# Milestones Screen Implementation

## Overview

The Milestones screen displays developmental milestones grouped by age ranges, with visual indicators for completed milestones.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Visual Design**
- Header with "Milestone Journey" title
- Age-grouped sections (0-3 months, 4-7 months, etc.)
- Milestone items with 80x80 rounded images
- Green background and checkmark for logged milestones
- White cards with hover effect for unlogged milestones

### 2. **Data Structure**
- Only shows milestones that have corresponding images
- Images stored in `assets/milestones/` directory
- Milestone descriptions for key items
- Sorted by predefined order within each category

### 3. **Interaction States**
- Logged milestones show completion date
- Unlogged milestones show descriptions
- Touch feedback on all milestone items
- Chevron icon for navigation to detail (TODO)

### 4. **Convex Integration**
- `milestones.ts`: Query all milestones
- `milestoneEntries.ts`: CRUD operations for milestone logging
- Filters to show only milestones with images

## Files Created/Modified

1. **Screen Component**
   - `src/screens/MilestonesScreen.tsx`

2. **Convex Functions**
   - `convex/milestones.ts`
   - `convex/milestoneEntries.ts`

3. **Assets**
   - `assets/milestones/` - Contains all milestone images

## Image Mapping

Currently supporting 43 milestones with images:
- 0-3 Months: 7 milestones
- 4-7 Months: 12 milestones
- 8-12 Months: 9 milestones
- 1-2 Years: 8 milestones
- 2-5 Years: 7 milestones

## Usage

The screen automatically:
1. Fetches all milestones from Convex
2. Filters to show only those with images
3. Groups by age category
4. Shows completion status based on milestone entries
5. Displays in a scrollable list

## Next Steps

1. **Milestone Detail Modal**
   - Allow logging/editing milestone
   - Add photo attachment
   - Add notes
   - Date picker for achievement date

2. **Animations**
   - Celebration animation on milestone completion
   - Smooth transitions between states

3. **Progress Indicators**
   - Show percentage completed per category
   - Overall milestone progress

4. **Export/Share**
   - Generate milestone report
   - Share milestone achievements
