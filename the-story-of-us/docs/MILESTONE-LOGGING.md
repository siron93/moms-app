# Milestone Logging Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the milestone logging functionality that allows parents to track and record their baby's developmental milestones.

## Features

### 1. **Milestone Logging Modal**
- Date picker for achievement date (defaults to today)
- Optional notes field for adding details
- Photo upload capability with local-first storage
- Special fields for certain milestones (e.g., "First Word" has an input for the actual word)

### 2. **Special Milestones**
Currently supported special milestones with custom fields:
- **First Word**: Includes a field to record the actual word spoken

### 3. **Timeline Integration**
- Milestones appear in the timeline with special styling
- Green background with celebration icon
- Special milestones show additional data (e.g., the actual first word in quotes)
- Photos are displayed if attached

### 4. **Data Architecture**

#### Schema Updates
```typescript
milestoneEntries: {
  // ... existing fields
  photoLocalPath: v.optional(v.string()),
  metadata: v.optional(v.any()), // Stores milestone-specific data
}
```

#### Special Milestone Configuration
```typescript
const SPECIAL_MILESTONES = {
  'First Word': {
    fields: [{
      key: 'word',
      label: 'What was the word?',
      placeholder: 'Enter the first word',
    }],
  },
};
```

## Components

### 1. **MilestoneLogModal** (`src/components/MilestoneLogModal.tsx`)
- Handles both general and special milestone logging
- Manages photo uploads with local-first approach
- Creates both milestone entry and timeline memory

### 2. **MilestoneCard** (in `src/components/MemoryCard.tsx`)

- Shows milestone-specific metadata (e.g., first word)
- Displays attached photos

### 3. **Updated MilestonesScreen**
- Opens logging modal when milestone is tapped
- Shows logged milestones with green background and checkmark
