# The Story of Us - Implementation Plan

## Project Setup âœ“
- React Native with Expo and TypeScript
- Convex for real-time database
- Clerk for authentication
- NativeWind for styling
- React Navigation for navigation

## Database Design Considerations

### Anonymous Usage Strategy
1. **Anonymous ID Generation**: Generate a unique ID on first app launch
2. **Store in SecureStore**: Persist anonymous ID across app sessions
3. **Data Association**: All data created links to anonymous ID
4. **Migration on Auth**: When user signs up/logs in, migrate all anonymous data

### Data Structure Principles
- **Minimal Required Fields**: Only babyId and timestamp are truly required
- **Flexible Schema**: Support various memory types in single table
- **Efficient Queries**: Index by date, type, and tags for fast filtering
- **Real-time Updates**: Leverage Convex subscriptions for live data

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. **Anonymous User System**
   - Generate and persist anonymous ID
   - Create anonymous data helpers
   - Set up migration logic

2. **Basic Navigation**
   - Bottom tab navigator
   - Floating action button
   - Screen placeholders

3. **Convex Schema**
   - Implement core tables
   - Set up indexes
   - Create basic queries/mutations

### Phase 2: Timeline & Memories
1. **Timeline Screen**
   - Memory feed with infinite scroll
   - Mixed content types (photos, journal, milestones)
   - Date grouping

2. **Add Memory Flow**
   - Photo/video capture
   - Journal entry creation
   - Quick milestone logging

### Phase 3: Tracking Features
1. **Daily Trackers**
   - Feeding (breast/bottle/solids)
   - Sleep tracking with timer
   - Diaper logging

2. **Growth Tracking**
   - Weight/height/head measurements
   - Growth charts
   - Percentile calculations

### Phase 4: Milestones & Sanctuary
1. **Milestone Journey**
   - Age-grouped milestones
   - Achievement tracking
   - Photo attachments

2. **Sanctuary Tab**
   - Meditation player
   - Breathing exercises
   - Journal prompts

### Phase 5: Authentication & Polish
1. **Clerk Integration**
   - Sign up/login flow
   - Data migration from anonymous
   - Profile management

2. **Polish & Optimization**
   - Animations and transitions
   - Error handling
   - Performance optimization

## Key Technical Decisions

### State Management
- Convex for server state (real-time subscriptions)
- React Context for UI state (modals, navigation)
- SecureStore for persistent local data

### Image Handling
- Expo Image Picker for camera/gallery
- Convex file storage for uploads
- Cached thumbnails for performance

### Styling Approach
- NativeWind for Tailwind-like styling
- Custom theme with warm colors
- Consistent spacing and typography

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load images in timeline
- Paginate large data sets
- Optimize Convex queries
- Minimize re-renders

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utilities
- Integration tests for Convex functions
- E2E tests for critical flows
- Manual testing on iOS/Android
